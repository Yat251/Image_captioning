## 1. Project Overview
This project focuses on generating descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques. The model leverages a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence generation.


## 2. Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset consisting of images paired with their respective captions. The dataset is preprocessed to normalize images and tokenize captions for efficient training and inference.

## 3. Model Architecture

The architecture comprises:

**Feature Extraction**: A pretrained CNN model is used to extract features from images.
**Caption Generation**: An RNN, often an LSTM, is used to generate captions based on the extracted features.


## 4. Installation
Clone the repository:
*git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-captioning-project.git*

Install the required packages:
*pip install -r requirements.txt*


## 5. Usage
Preprocess the dataset:
*python preprocess.py --data_dir path/to/data*

Train the model:
*python train.py --config config.yaml*

Generate captions for new images:
*python generate_captions.py --image_dir path/to/images*

## 6. Results
The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating relevant and coherent captions for a wide range of images. Evaluation metrics include BLEU scores, ROUGE scores, and CIDEr scores, with detailed results available in the project report.
